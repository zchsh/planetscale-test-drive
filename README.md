# Planetscale Test Drive

This is a repo I've set up to test out PlanetScale. Lots to learn!

## Steps so far

- 1. Followed [PlanetScale's CLI Quick-Start tutorial](https://docs.planetscale.com/tutorials/planetscale-quick-start-guide#quick-start-with-the-planetscale-cli)
  - End result is a test database, with a `main` branch, "promoted to production"
- 2. Set up this repo

## Next steps

- [ ] Build a simple app that accesses and displays data from the database
- [ ] Learn about and test out data branching
- [ ] Learn about and test out schema changes (made via "deploy requests"?)
